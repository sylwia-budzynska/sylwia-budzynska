### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 I am a security researcher at GitHub, where I find and disclose vulnerabilities in open source software, and publish my research as advisories and blog posts.

 Check out some of my blog posts:
- [CodeQL zero to hero part 1: the fundamentals of static analysis for vulnerability research](https://github.blog/2023-03-31-codeql-zero-to-hero-part-1-the-fundamentals-of-static-analysis-for-vulnerability-research/)
- [CodeQL zero to hero part 2: getting started with CodeQL](https://github.blog/2023-06-15-codeql-zero-to-hero-part-2-getting-started-with-codeql/)
- [CodeQL zero to hero part 3: security research](https://github.blog/2024-04-29-codeql-zero-to-hero-part-3-security-research-with-codeql/)
- [CodeQL zero to hero part 4: Gradio case study](https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/codeql-zero-to-hero-part-4-gradio-framework-case-study/)
- [CodeQL zero to hero part 5: debugging queries](https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/codeql-zero-to-hero-part-5-debugging-queries/)

All supplementary queries, challanges and instructions to the CodeQL zero to hero blog posts are available in the [codeql-zero-to-hero](https://github.com/GitHubSecurityLab/codeql-zero-to-hero) repo.

I've found 80+ CVEs. Most of my advisories are published on GitHub Security Lab's website, together with other great researchers from GitHub. Check out our work at [securitylab.github.com/advisories](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/).
